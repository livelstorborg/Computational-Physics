# Computational Physics

This repository contains all projects completed for the Computational Physics course, demonstrating numerical methods and simulations for solving physics problems.

**Note**: This repository contains the final versions of projects uploaded from local development. The complete development history and commit messages from the original collaborative work are not included in this GitHub repository.


## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to computational methods essential for solving physics and chemistry problems. The curriculum covers core numerical techniques including ordinary and partial differential equations, linear algebra operations, eigenvalue problems, numerical integration, and Monte Carlo simulations. 

Students gain hands-on experience with C++ programming and Git version control while developing skills in scientific modeling and computational problem-solving. The course emphasizes practical implementation of algorithms and includes training in scientific report writing to communicate results effectively.

Each project demonstrates the application of these numerical methods to real-world physics problems, building proficiency in both theoretical understanding and computational implementation.

## Projects

### Project 1: Numerical Solutions of the Poisson Equation

### Project 2: Eigenvalue Problems and Jacobi's Rotation Method

### Project 3: Resonance phenomena in the simulation of Calcium ions in a Penning trap using numerical integration methods

### Project 4: Numerical study of magnetic phase transitions and critical temperature in a ferromagnet using the 2D Ising model

### Project 5: Numerically simulating the 2D many slit experiment using the Crank-Nicolson method

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core computational algorithms and simulations
- **Python**: Data analysis, visualization, and plotting (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- **Git**: Version control

## Running the Code

Each project contains its own build instructions and dependencies. Generally:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Compile using `make` or follow specific build instructions
3. Run the main executable
4. Results and plots will be generated automatically
